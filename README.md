### Using your credentials
1. Register a Spotify App and add a redirect URI, e.g. http://localhost:8081/callback.
2. Create a `.env` file in the server directory with the following variables:
    * CLIENT_ID
    * CLIENT_SECRET
    * FRONTEND_URI
    * REDIRECT_URI
3. If using a different base url to `localhost:8081`, then replace the same url in [Login.vue](client/src/views/Login.vue) and [index.js](client/src/service/index.js)
4. Run `npm install` in the client and server directory separately to install dependencies. 

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
In the client directory, run:
```
npm run serve
```

### Compiles and minifies for production
```
npm run build
```
The build files are configured by [vue.config.js](client/vue.config.js) to be stored in [server/public](server/public). The build can
be run locally with the command `npm run dev` in the server directory.
